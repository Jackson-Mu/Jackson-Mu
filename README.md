### My Journey 🎬

Hi there! I'm Jackson, and I love making technology work for everyone. Imagine a giant puzzle - that's what I do with data and computers! I take tricky problems and turn them into simple, helpful solutions for people.

### What I Enjoy Doing 💪

- 📊 Making sense of numbers and data (like finding patterns in your favorite football team's games!)
- 💻 Creating websites and apps that make life easier
- 🤝 Explaining tech stuff in simple words (no techy talk here!)
- 🎨 Designing websites that are beautiful and easy to use
