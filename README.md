### My Story 📖

Hi, I’m Jackson! I love using computers to make life simpler — that’s my thing.

But honestly, if there’s a good football, basketball, or volleyball game on, I’ll watch it first, the computer might have to wait. Or I’ll do both at the same time — who says I can’t multitask?

### Things I Love to Do ⭐

- 📊 Making numbers tell fun stories
- 💻 Building websites that are easy to use
- 🤝 Helping people understand computers
- 🎨 Making pretty tools that work well
