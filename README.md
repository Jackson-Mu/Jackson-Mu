### What's My Story? 🎬

Hi! I'm Jackson, and I love making technology work for everyone. Imagine having a huge puzzle - that's what I do with data and computers! I take complicated problems and turn them into simple, useful solutions that help people.

### What I Love Doing 💪

- 📊 Making sense of numbers and data (like finding patterns in your favorite football team's performance!)
- 💻 Building websites and apps that make life easier
- 🤝 Explaining tech stuff in simple words (no complicated jargon here!)
- 🎨 Making websites look beautiful and easy to use
